## Exponential Growth

While I enjoyed web development, the front-end never _fully clicked_ for me until I started using React a few years later in my first full-time job. Up until this point, most "modern web development" at the time seemed so complex. Learning React, and then starting to use Create React App, helped me finally break free from JavaScript build tool hell and focus on building great websites. This is when I started to grow exponentially as a developer.

Specializing on one specific thing (React) led to a snowball effect. Suddenly, I was becoming proficient in other related skills. Understanding the fundamentals led to faster adoption of the next layer of tools, and finally to understanding and creating my own backends and APIs.

> **Takeaway:** It's never too late to change your trajectory. Your career is a marathon, not a sprint.

### Backend (as a Service)

These are (typically) managed services that automate the creation of code based on your [database schema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BZz8R7mqu0).
You might see these referred to as "in a box" solutions. For example, Hasura provides a GraphQL API in a box as part of the platform.

```bash
Weighted Rating (WR) = (v ÷ (v + m)) × R + (m ÷ (v + m)) × C
Where:
R = rating average for this business
v = number of ratings for this business
m = minimum ratings required
C = the mean rating across the entire list
```
